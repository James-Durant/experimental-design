# Examples
This demonstration is intended to provide a simplified interface to the Fisher information framework. To apply the framework to your own experimental design problems, you can modify the example models in the following files:
* [angle.py](/demo/angle.py) - Angle choice for a simple sample with thin layers.
* [contrast.py](/demo/contrast.py) - Contrast choice for an asymmetric bilayer model.
* [underlayer.py](/demo/underlayer.py) - Underlayer choice for a symmetric bilayer model.

To run an example, you can call the file from the command line (e.g. ```python angle.py```) and the output will be saved to [results](/demo/results).
