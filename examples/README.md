## Examples
The following examples are intended to provide simplified interfaces into the Fisher information framework. To apply the framework to your own experimental design problems, you can modify the example models in the following [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) notebooks:
* [angle.ipynb](/examples/angle.ipynb) - Angle choice(s) for a simple sample with thin layers.
* [contrast.ipynb](/examples/contrast.ipynb) - Contrast choice(s) for a 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) bilayer model.
* [simulation.ipynb](/examples/simulation.ipynb) - Simulating an experiment for a simple sample using [refnx](https://refnx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Refl1D](https://refl1d.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

To run an example, you can call the file from the command line (e.g., ```jupyter notebook angle.py```).
