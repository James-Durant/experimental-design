# Examples
The following examples are intended to provide a simplified interface to the Fisher information framework. To apply the framework to your own experimental design problems, you can modify the example models in the following [jupyter](https://jupyter.org) notebooks:
* [angle.ipynb](/demo/angle.ipynb) - Angle choice(s) for a simple sample with thin layers.
* [contrast.ipynb](/demo/contrast.ipynb) - Contrast choice(s) for an asymmetric bilayer model.
* [underlayer.ipynb](/demo/underlayer.ipynb) - Underlayer choice for a symmetric bilayer model.

To run an example, you can call the file from the command line (e.g., ```jupyter notebook angle.py```) and the outputs will be saved to [results](/demo/results).
