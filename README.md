2. To activate the environment, run: ```conda activate experimental-design```

3. Install pip by running: ```conda install pip```

4. Run the following to install the required packages from the [requirements.txt](/requirements.txt) file: <br />
   ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

You should now be able to run the code. Please ensure you are running a version of Python >= 3.8.0 \
