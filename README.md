## About the Project
**For the original repositories that this work is based on, see [fisher-information](https://github.com/James-Durant/fisher-information) and [experimental-design](https://github.com/James-Durant/experimental-design)**.

Using the Fisher information (FI), the design of neutron reflectometry experiments can be optimised, leading to greater confidence in parameters of interest and better use of experimental time. This package contains modules and data for optimising the design of a wide range of reflectometry experiments.

Please refer to the [notebooks](https://github.com/jfkcooper/HOGBEN/tree/main/notebooks) for an introduction on how to use the code.


This repository is named after Lancelot Hogben, whose relentless opposition of eugenics (and vocal criticism of Ronald Fisher's views on it) we applaud.
